        <p>
            Welcome to our homepage! Above you can see the picture on the cover 
            of our newest album called the &#34;Broken Unbreakables&#34;. This 
            album talks about how we constantly make promises to ourselves and 
            others about how things will last forever, but yet sometimes it 
            doesn't work how we want. Just like the lifetime warranty on the 
            socks which obviously have a hole in them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides our newest album, you can also find our tour dates, apparel, 
            accessories, sponsors, and just a little bit more about us on the 
            links at the top of the page. Thank you for supporting our band and 
            we hope to see you at one of our upcoming concerts.
        </p>
