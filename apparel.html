        <p>This page has all of our current apparel options. If you would like us to add anything to this please let us know! If you have designs for clothes that fit our bands style we will happily add them to our list below! However, you should know that by sending us your designs to sell you are giving us full rights over the design and and money gained from it, although we do generally give the designers 10&#37; of all profits made from their designs. This being said it usually takes about 5 business minuets to get a new design approved and put up on the website, so we ask that you have patience with us.</p>
        <p>We would also like to mention that the clothes of bandmembers will only last as long as we have some in stock, however at every concert we give away one item, per member, that we wore during the performance, so if make sure to get front row seats and you might be able to catch our freshly used socks!! </p>
