            <h1>Apparel</h1>
        </header>

        <p>This page has all of our current apparel options. If you would like 
        us to add anything to this please let us know! If you have designs for 
        clothes that fit our bands style we will happily add them to our list 
        below! However, you should know that by sending us your designs to sell 
        you are giving us full rights over the design and and money gained from 
        it, although we do generally give the designers 10&#37; of all profits 
        made from their designs. This being said it usually takes about 5 
        business minuets to get a new design approved and put up on the website, 
        so we ask that you have patience with us.</p>
        <p>We would also like to mention that the clothes of bandmembers will 
        only last as long as we have some in stock, however at every concert we 
        give away one item, per member, that we wore during the performance, so 
        if make sure to get front row seats and you might be able to catch our 
        freshly used socks!! </p>
        <p><!-- new from matt w-->
    We have an announcement to make. The Angry Socks have made first contact with some rather colorful known as Disaster Area, who claim to have no setting less than 100,000. While we are unsure of their measurements, we have graciously accepted their offer and will for a limited time be offering exclusive merchandise for their band on our webpage! Rock On Angry Socks!
</p>
        <p>We have another big announcement! We have made first contact with aliens! Apparently they are known as Disaster Area and share our love of Rock and Socks. They describe themselves as " a plutonium rock band from the Gagrakaka Mind Zones, and claim to be the loudest noise of any kind"-"Douglas Adams". We said that of course they would have to prove that, and so they are launching a tour with us now known for some reason as the Farewell Earth Tour. So get your merch and we hope you join us on January 1, 2022 in Times Square for the Farewell Earth Tour!
